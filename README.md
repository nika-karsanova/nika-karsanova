👋 Hi, I’m Nika! 

Welcome to my rather empty GitHub page. If you wondering what happened and where did all repositories go - I realised that they were terribly structured and I would much rather re-upload them from scratch. So expect several old projects from my university life and side hustles to be uploaded sometime in the next few months.

🌱 I am a recent graduate in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence from Aberystwyth University. That means, that recently I completed a dissertation! It addressed the problem of biased judging in subjective sports like Figure Skating. I got to learn a lot about Computer Vision and extend my knowledge of Machine Learning even further than before! As a result, I have created a system, which was able to perform Action Recognition in real-time and comment on the events occuring in the raw video footage.

Currently, I work with Careers Office at Aberystwyth University, where I collect and analyse data, develop applications, and conduct research to improve the marketing strategy and student engagement with the department. Additionally, I am an Assistant Software Engineer for the research teams in Biology Department, helping them with automation of tedious tasks, so that they can go back to doing interesting experiments without thinking about doing Image Analysis :)

In the last year, I had experience working on advanced Machine Learning Systems at VerifiedVisitors, developing applications using Python 3, Pandas, NumPy, GCP and other platforms and technologies. At the moment, I work part-time as a teaching assistant, instructing and assisting students in my department on various topics of Computer Science, as well as helping Careers Office at Aberystwyth University to collect and analyse the feedback of the student body. 

👀 In my free time I love to read, bake, play video games, which leads to another area of interest for me: game development. While I didn't get to build anything serious yet, I'm thrilled to do more projects in Unity and other game engines. I'm also a big fan of figure skating, hence the topic of my dissertation.

💞️ I would be interested to collaborate on the creation of a couple of small indie games, or open-source projects. So, if you would be too, feel free to reach out.

📫 The most convenient way to get in touch would be via e-mail: vero.karsanova@gmail.com

Have a wonderful day! Хорошего дня! Passe une bonne journée! 今日楽しんでください !
